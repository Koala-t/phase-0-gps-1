# GPS 1 reflection

* Before this session I was struggling with branching and merging on github with multiple collaborators working on the same repo.

* I got some good practice with branching and merging and feel much more comfortable with them after pairing.

* I asked my pair for help remembering some git commands we have already learned and I asked the guide for help understanding some nuances on the use of git push. 

* I am not aware of any big gaps in my understanding of git now but I still need more practice before I can feel comfortable with the workflow. 

* My first GPS pairing was a good experience. It was nice having a navigator who can spot typos, help keep things rolling by checking the instructions or looking up sources when the other person is driving. The guide was also great. He didn't hold our hand to get us through the exercise but he did step in when we were stuck for a while or getting too far off track.
