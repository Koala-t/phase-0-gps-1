###GPS 1.1- Release 7

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
Prior to the GPS session I didnt have any previous knowledge of using the commands `git fetch` and `git merge` as a means to update your local directory to the remote. Therefore, I struggled a bit to understand the proper syntax and use. However, my pair helped by showing me the command `git remote -v` and also by working together to understand what those commands do. 


**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
As discussed above, the commands `git fetch` and `git merge` were clarified. Furthermore, I understood the process of adding a collaborator, but had not actually done that, so now I fully comprehend how to add a collaborator to a repository. 
I also struggled with understanding why the changes I was making and merging from my local computer, weren't listed in my repositories. However, our guide, Daniel, did a great job making me understand that the repository was in my pair's GitHub account, so my changes were pushed to the repository in his GitHub. I was a collaborator, not the owner. 

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
Apart from asking the introductory questions about how we were and about the navigator and driver roles, I asked several questions, that I can remember:

1. How do we use the command `git fetch`? 
2. What is `git remote -v`?
3. How do we check out the "diff" on GitHub? 
4. Why can't I see the repository on my account?


**What still confuses you about Git?**
Again, my major confusion with Git arrived when I didnt see changes to the repository we worked on in my GitHub account. I didnt understand why there wasnt a copy of the repo in my account. However, I understood, thanks to my guide. If I wanted a copy in my GitHub, I would've used fork instead of clone when starting the assignment. As of now, I understand the concepts of Git workflow: the importance of working off of a branch, or adding files and committing the changes to Git. What I dont understand fully is what I havent had experience with. For me, reading about a topic in Git is never the same as when I practice it in a meaningful exercise. So I dont fully understand how to revert to a previous commit or how to reset a merge just because I havent actually executed those things. 


**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
I think my first experience went well. I felt very comfortable working with my pair and guide. I felt there was good communication with my pair and that we were working at the same pace. I also liked having a guide present, because if there was ever a time that my pair and I were both confused and couldnt figure something out or wanted confirmation, we had our guide as a reference. It made me feel more "secure" having someone with experience check our work as we did it.
